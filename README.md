# Letterboxd-Friends-Ratings-Analyzer
Shows the average rating given by your Letterboxd friends. No jQuery, no bs. Note that since I parse the ratings using DOM only, the average will be calculated using only the first 10 ratings from friends that appear. Getting all friends would require reworking the script quite extensively, which I'm currently not interested in doing. Sorry!

TODO: solve weird padding issue under avg rating number. Idk why it looks like that

What it looks like currently:
